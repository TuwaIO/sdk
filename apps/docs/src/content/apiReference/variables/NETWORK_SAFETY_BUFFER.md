Defined in: [packages/quasar-sdk/src/utils/auth.ts:37](https://github.com/TuwaIO/sdk/blob/1a17de617fb94f0662aae90cb9092921f4a6e2bd/packages/quasar-sdk/src/utils/auth.ts#L37)

Safety buffer subtracted from DEFAULT_MAX_AGE during cache validation.
Ensures the session is refreshed before it expires on the server,
accounting for network round-trip latency between client cache check
and server-side verifyMiniSession call.
